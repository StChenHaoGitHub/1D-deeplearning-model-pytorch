# One-demotion-deeplearning-model

To do a deep learning project on ecg. I use pytorch to reproduce the traditional CNN models include LeNet AlexNet ZFNet VGG GoogLeNet ResNet DenseNet MonileNetV1-3 ShuffuleNet EfficientV0 with one demotion and more.  
In order to understand models easily, I',m not copy  the Official routines,but reprodece the models by myself.Therefore itâ€™s easy to carry out secondary developmet on codes.  
If you can access VPN in China,Here are some websites for detialed steps of reproducing these models.These websites  are written by me in chinese.
