# One-demotion-deeplearning-model-LeNet-AlexNet-ZFNet-VGG-GoogLeNet-ResNet-DenseNet

为了做一个心电信号项目，我使用pytorch复现了，经典的所有类型的一维深度学系网络，包括LeNet AlexNet ZFNet VGG GoogLeNet ResNet DenseNet 等 .  
To do a deep learning project on ecg. I use pytorch to reproduce the traditional CNN models include LeNet AlexNet ZFNet VGG GoogLeNet ResNet DenseNet with one demotion and more.  
In order to understand models easily, I',m not copy  the Official routines,but reprodece the models by myself.Therefore it’s easy to carry out secondary developmet on codes.  
If you can access VPN in China,Here are some websites for detialed steps of reproducing these models.These websites  are written by me in chinese.
