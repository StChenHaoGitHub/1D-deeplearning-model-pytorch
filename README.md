# One-demotion-deeplearning-model

To do a deep learning project on ecg. I use pytorch to reproduce the traditional CNN models include LeNet AlexNet ZFNet VGG GoogLeNet ResNet DenseNet MonileNetV1-3 ShuffuleNet EfficientV0 with one demotion and more.  
In order to understand models easily, I',m not copy  the Official routines,but reprodece the models by myself.Therefore itâ€™s easy to carry out secondary developmet on codes.
